	/*!
	  A soft E excitation adds dE to the field every step, so the NET charge it
	  deposits is proportional to the time-integral of its waveform. If that
	  integral is non-zero the leftover is an electrostatic field, and inside a
	  structure closed by PEC there is nothing that can remove it: it simply
	  sits there and stops any energy-based convergence test from ever tripping.

	  Measured on a PTFE coax driven at 1.55 +- 1.45 GHz, whose waveform carries
	  |V(f=0)| = 0.153 of its spectral peak: a static transverse field pinned to
	  the source plane at 16x the line background, holding 85% of all the static
	  residue in the model, still there after 300000 timesteps. The same model
	  driven at 2.10 +- 0.80 GHz, where |V(f=0)| = 0.0000, converges normally.

	  The correction subtracts a Hann-shaped bump scaled to cancel the integral
	  exactly. A plain mean subtraction would leave a step at both ends of the
	  support -- broadband, and worse than what it fixes. The Hann vanishes at
	  both ends with zero slope, so the corrected waveform still starts and ends
	  quietly. It necessarily reshapes the spectrum immediately around DC; that
	  is the part which cannot propagate anyway.
